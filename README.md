Calculator GUI similar to windows calculator. Handles a single operation, does not crash or output anything if an invalid operation is done. The program takes input from the text box according to user's pressed buttons after the equals operation is entered. Then a calculated result is shown in the second text box.

Created with Java objext oriented concepts. Used Java Swing and AWT to make the GUI inputs and outputs. Used String manipulation to parse input fields.
